# Incredible Technical Speakers
These are the folks to learn from when you're figuring out how to give a 
talk on software development. Every person on this list has both software
development chops and the ability to engage an audience of their peers with
a powerful presentation.

The [inclusion requirements](#inclusion-requirements) and 
[selection criteria](#selection-criteria) I used to pick the speakers 
are listed at the bottom of this README.


## The talks (alphabetical order by last name)
* **[Greg Baugues](https://github.com/GregBaugues)'s 
  [Developers and Depression](https://vimeo.com/78419167) from
  the Business of Software 2013.**  
  Powerful storytelling. A moving talk on a serious subject rarely 
  discussed publicly in the software development industry.

* **[David Beazley](https://github.com/dabeaz)'s
  [Python Concurrency From the Ground Up: LIVE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4)
  during PyCon US 2015.** An entirely live coded 
  talk that inspires and teaches the difficult computer science
  topic of concurrency.

* **[Gary Bernhardt](https://github.com/garybernhardt)'s 
  [Wat](https://archive.org/details/wat_destroyallsoftware)
  from CodeMash 2012.**  
  This hilarious classic lightning talk is a great demonstration of 
  explaining confusing technical concepts using humor.


* **[Mary Rose Cook](https://github.com/maryrosecook)'s 
  [Mary Live-Codes a JavaScript Game from Scratch](https://vimeo.com/105955605)
  at Front-Trends 2014.**  
  Magical live coding. The talk combines programming with explanations while
  typing. Along the way Mary demos the code to the audience so they can 
  see what's being created.


* **[Angelina Fabbro](https://github.com/afabbro)'s
  [JavaScript Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0TFmdO4ZP0) 
  during JSConfUS 2013.**  
  Addresses the difficult question of what topics separate beginner, 
  intermediate and advanced programmers. Despite the title this talk is not 
  specific to JavaScript and worthwhile to developers of all languages.


* **[Scott Hanselman](https://github.com/shanselman)'s 
  [Virtual Machines, JavaScript and Assembler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzyoT4DziQ4)
  from Fluent 2014.**  
  This keynote talk shows off the power of dry humor combined 
  with strong visuals and storytelling.


* **[Kate Heddleston](https://github.com/heddle317)'s 
  [So you want to be a full-stack developer? How to build a full-stack Python web application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uxQOzKi3_0) at PyCon 2014.**  
  Kate's rendition of the Brady Bunch song set to her own software 
  development-themed lyrics went over incredibly well with her 
  audience. The hand drawn visuals from her talk also went perfectly with 
  the presentation style.


* **[Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s
  [More Git and GitHub Secrets](https://vimeo.com/72955426) at WDCNZ 2013.**  
  Engages both beginners and advanced users with the talk. Uses humor well to
  keep the audience engaged.


* **[Jessica McKellar](https://github.com/jesstess)'s 
  [Building and breaking a Python sandbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL_syMmRkoU)
  from PyCon 2014.**  
  The talk's storytelling while traveling through the lower levels of the 
  Python interpreter keep the audience engaged from start to finish.


* **[Katrina Owen](https://github.com/kytrinyx)'s
  [467 tests, 0 failures, 0 confidence](https://vimeo.com/68730418)
  at Railsberry 2013.**  
  Great pacing, voice tone variation and usage of real world analogies to get 
  across the concepts on software testing in this talk.


* **[Brandon Rhodes](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes)'s 
  [The Mighty Dictionary](http://pyvideo.org/video/276/the-mighty-dictionary-55)
  during PyCon 2010.**  
  The speaking style and clarity in expressing concepts through concrete
  examples command audience attention.


* **[Philip Roberts](https://github.com/latentflip)'s 
  [What the heck is the event loop anyway?](http://phatak-dev.github.io/techtalks/javascript-event-loop/) from JSConf EU 2014.**  
  Clear explanations go along with strong visuals and live demos to explain 
  low level technical details.


* **[Saron Yitbarek](https://github.com/sarony)'s 
  [Reading code good](http://phatak-dev.github.io/techtalks/reading-code-good/) 
  at RailsConf 2014.**  
  A well spoken and thoughtful talk on how to read code with fellow developers 
  to improve your programming abilities. Weaves personal stories throughout
  the presentation to bring home the main points.

* *My own* best technical talk: **[Matt Makai](https://github.com/makaimc)'s 
  [WebSockets in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5YQbNrFfyw) presented 
  at the SF Python January 2014 meetup.** This is my own favorite technical that 
  I've given out of my 50+ talks over the past couple of years. The talk has a whole 
  lot of live coding and audience interaction with the application as I wrote the code.


## Inclusion requirements <a name="inclusion-requirements"></a>
Developing or designing software must be a major part of his or her gig 
at the time the talk is given.

The talk content must focus on software development or issues directly 
pertinent to software developer's lives


## Selection criteria <a name="selection-criteria"></a>
This list is less about the specific subject matter and more about the
speakers' command of the material and audience. There are many different 
speaking styles.  

Not all styles are applicable to all topics. The list below should give you
ideas for what style may be most appropriate for you and your subject matter.

If a speaker meets the inclusion requirements then a talk will be considered
based on the following measures:

* clarity of thought transfer to the audience
* live coding & demo or clear slides that enhance the technical discussion
* speaking tone variation where appropriate
* humor
* engaging
* storytelling
* minimal crutch phrases
* eye contact
* hand work (working with "the box")
* strings
* roots
* respect for the audience
* bonus points: using a new and effective way to teach or explain content.

## Notes & Caveats
* This list is just a starting point. I'm definitely missing many of the 
  best software developer speakers on here. Submit a pull request with your
  pick.

* For each speaker I tried to pick the "best" talk. If there's one that is
  far better than the talk shown, submit a pull request.

* I have not explored the entire Internet (yet) so it's likely there are entire
  communities whose talks I have not seen. File an issue with a link to a talks
  list so I can watch those speakers' talks.
